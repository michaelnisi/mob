# mob - stress stateless web APIs

*mob* is small Erlang application to stress test HTTP APIs.

## Example

With `random_gun_request/1`, given a pid of a [*gun*](https://github.com/ninenines/gun) connection process, issuing a random *gun* request and returning the identifier of the stream, this example would hit `"localhost"` on port `8000` on five *gun* connectionsâ€”continuously, variated slightly in timing, until *mob* is stopped with `mob:stop/0`.

```erlang
mob:start("localhost", 8000).
mob:add(fun random_gun_request/1, 5).
```
